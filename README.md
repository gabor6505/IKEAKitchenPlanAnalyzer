# IKEA Kitchen Plan Analyzer
Cross-platform Java app for viewing/analyzing kitchen plans generated by IKEA in nicely organised tables and calculating prices

**Tested with Java 8 & 12 on Windows 10**

### Usage:
1. **Export a kitchen plan PDF** file from the IKEA KitchenPlanner site: 
   * Press the 'Item List'/'Elemlista' button
   * Press 'Print'
   * Print it to a PDF file ('Destination' > 'Save as PDF' on Chrome)
2. Load the file, enjoy the app :)

### Features:
* View items sorted in the default order (the same way as seen in the PDF)
* **View items sorted by their categories** (e.g. Front covers, Electronics, Drawers)
* **Price calculation:** Check/uncheck items/groups to recalculate the price of the whole plan

**Price calculator:** Calculate price for custom made wood pieces  
1. Choose what types you want to calculate (supports front/drawer/side covers, shelves and worktops)
2. Set the price for 1 sq meter
3. See the result calculated in real-time (from the total area of the selected wood pieces and the price/sq m you specified)
4. Press the 'Apply' button - if you want the corresponding IKEA items to be replaced by your custom ones and to recalculate the total price

The price calculator currently works with metric (SI) units only (centimeter, meter etc.), thus you can only use it on Hungarian & British plans


P.S. How nice it would be if IKEA provided an API for their Kitchen Planner, so the app didn't have to rely on text recognition...
